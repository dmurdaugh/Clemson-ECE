ANALYSIS
The hash function used allows for each word to have a very unique key. This 
makes looking them up very easy as well as finding a place to put them since there shouldn't be many collisions. Also due to the way the hash table is implemented in design all information needed is readily available and not costly to access. This allows the commands to be processed efficiently.
